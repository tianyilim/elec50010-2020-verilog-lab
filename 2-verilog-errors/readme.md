Verilog Errors
==============

Each example here consists of a design and a test-bench.
The design and/or the test-bench contain common errors
or problems that need fixing. They are also opportunities
for you to develop your skills in terms of:

- Reading synthesisable Verilog
- Translating Verilog to circuit diagrams
- Reading and modifying test-benches
- Working with compilation and simulation
- Interpreting wave-forms

v1 - 8-bit incrementor
----------------------

The module `add4` (correctly) implements an 8-bit incrementor. The test-bench (incorrectly)
claims that it does not work.

Fix the test-bench.

Discussion:

- What is the underlying error?
- Does the compiler warn you about the problem?
- How will you avoid this type of error?


v2 - 1-bit Flip-Flop
--------------------

The module `ff` is supposed to implement a 1-bit Flip-Flop. The test-bench
(correctly) claims that it does not work.

Fix the flip-flop.

Discussion:

- What does the waveform look like? Can you explain it?
- What is the underlying error?
- Does the compiler try to help you avoid this type of error?
- What happens if you use `always_ff` in the original (broken) FF, rather than `always`?

v3 - 1-bit Flip-Flop with clock-enable
-------------------------------------

The module `ff` is supposed to implement a 1-bit Flip-Flop with a clock-enable - as
with a normal flip-flop it only updates `q` at the rising edge of the clock,
but it also requires that `ce` is asserted. The test-bench (correctly) claims that
it does not work, but the test-bench itself is also not correct.

Fix the flip-flop and the test-bench.

Discussion:

- Did the compiler suggest there is a problem?
- The test-bench is correct that the FF does not work, but still contains an error. How can you
    detect errors in test-benches?
- Both the FF and bench-mark use examples of poor style. Try to recognise them, and the errors they might cause.
- The test-bench never modifies `clock_enable`. Why might that be a problem?

v4 - Or gate
------------

The module `or_gate.v` is supposed to implement an "or" gate, but the test-bench
(correctly) claims that it does not work.

Fix the or gate.

Discussion:

- Did the compiler suggest there is a problem?
- Does replacing `always` with `always_comb` change the way the compiler views it?
- Why is the module called `or_gate` rather than just `or`?
- How many different ways or styles of specifying the or gates logic can you come up with?
- Which style do you think is clearest and/or least error prone?

v5 - 4-bit combinatorial adder
------------------------------

The module `fadd` implements a 1-bit full-adder, which the module `add4` then
uses to build a 4-bit adder. The test-bench (correctly) indicates that the
4-bit adder does not work.

Fix the 4-bit adder.

Discussion:

- The adder is wrong due to an incorrect assumption about the semantics of buses (multi-wire signals) in Verilog. What is it?
- Assume you had to build a module `add32.v` which adds 32-bit values, but still had to rely on the `fadd` primitive. How might you do it?
- The test-bench for `add4.v` correctly identifies this problem through an exhaustive testing strategy. Would this strategy still work for `add32.v`?


v6 - 16-bit Hamming weight
--------------------------

The modules `hamming2`, `hamming4`, `hamming8`, and `hamming16` each calculate the Hamming weight of
2, 4, 8, or 16 bits. The Hamming weight is just a count of the number of set bits in the input - for
example, the hamming weight of `0101` is 2, `1110` is 3, and `1111` is 4. The programming style
uses recursive composition of modules to build the wider circuits out of the smaller circuits.

The test-bench claims that `hamming16` works, but this is incorrect - both the
circuit _and_ the test-bench contain errors.

Fix the test-bench, then fix the circuit.

Discussion:
- Both the test-bench and circuit were written by the same person. Why might this cause this type of error?
- The circuit was written before the test-bench. Why might this cause this type of error?
- The failure case is unlikely because it is rare. How might the test-bench be written to look for these cases?
- What is the advantage of this hierarchical composition style?
- How might you adapt the test-bench and test approach for a 64-bit hamming circuit?

v7 - Composite ALU
------------------

The module `add_sub_logic` constructs a 4 operation ALU around a single 16-bit adder (provided by `add16`) -
this is very similar to the construction of the bit-slice ALU in lectures, except the carry-chain is
included embedded in a Verilog multi-bit addition. In this case the design-under test is correct,
but the test-bench is wrong, though very close to being right.

Fix the test-bench.

Discussion:

- In this case the circuit and test-bench were developed independently, and it was initially unclear which one was correct. What
  could (or should) help resolve such situations?
- The case `op==3` in `add_sub_logic` has some edge-cases. What types of inputs (values of `a` and `b`) would be worth
    testing?
- The total set of possible inputs is very large. How might you create an "interesting" set of inputs that
    might trigger failure edge cases for all ops?
